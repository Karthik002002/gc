            The Indian Army transitioned from Everest Series Maps (ESM) to
            Defence Series Maps (DSM), requiring a device to output both grid
            references during the coexistence period. The Directorate General of
            Artillery (DG Arty) approached the Additional Director General
            Military Survey (ADG Mil Survey), which developed a prototype Proof
            of Concept (PoC). After Chief of Army Staff (COAS) approval, Elena
            Geo Tech Pvt Ltd was selected as the industrial partner to scale
            production.

            The device underwent rigorous verification by ADG Mil Survey teams
            nationwide before field trials. Initial trials revealed issues,
            prompting a complete redesign of the conversion process, including a
            new chipset and software. The upgraded device was validated by the
            Survey and Cartography Mapping Section (SCMS) at Army Headquarters
            and distributed to five artillery units for testing.

            Post successful field trials across diverse locations, including the
            School of Artilleryâ€™s Training and Testing Wing (TTW), the device
            was confirmed error-proof and operationally reliable. The Artillery
            Directorate subsequently approved it for procurement, finalizing its
            adoption under the project managed by SCMS and Army Headquarters.
