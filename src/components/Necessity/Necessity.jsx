      "The Grid Reference in Military Maps is the system used to align all our units to a single grid, and it is essential for operations. Currently, the Indian Army is transitioning from the old ESM to the DSM. Both use different Grid Reference System. Hence the shift from one to the other requires changes in the Grid References in Army documents, such as Operation Orders, Area of Responsibility, etc. This transition is expected to take up to 10 years. Additionally, many systems in the Army use the Lat-LongÂ system",
